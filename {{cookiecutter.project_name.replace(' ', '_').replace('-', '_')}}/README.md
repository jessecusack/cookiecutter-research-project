## Requirements

{%- if cookiecutter.include_python == 'yes' %}  

* Either Conda package manager (I recommend the lightweight version miniconda)
* Or pip package manager

{%- endif %}  

{%- if cookiecutter.include_matlab == 'yes' %}

* Matlab 2020b minimum

{%- endif %}  

{%- if cookiecutter.include_r == 'yes' %}  

* R 4.3.1
* R::renv
* JAGS 4.3.1
* Rtools 4.3
* R::rjags

{%- endif %}  

## Installing and removing the environment

{%- if cookiecutter.include_python == 'yes' %}

A conda environment is specified in environment.yml and may be install using the appropriate bash scripts.

To install:
```
./install_environment.sh
```
To remove:
```
./remove_environment.sh
```
These also install/remove the jupyter kernel for the environment.
> If these don't execute, you might need to change the file permissions with chmod u+x *.sh.

{%- endif %}


{%- if cookiecutter.include_matlab == 'yes' %}

A MATLAB project was created. Ressources are located in the folder with the same name. Open it with MATLAB.

{%- endif %}


{%- if cookiecutter.include_r == 'yes' %}

A R project was created. Open it with R.
An environment for R was created via renv. It is specified across `renv.lock`, `.Rprofile`, `renv/settings.json` and `renv/activate.R`. To operate with the project renv, first open the R Project `{{dir_name}}Rproj`.

To restore the environment:
```
renv::init()
renv::restore()
```

To deactivate the environment:
```
renv::deactivate()
```
This removes the renv auto-loader from the project .Rprofile, but doesn’t touch any other renv files used in the project. 

To later re-activate the environment:
```
renv::activate()
```

To completely remove the environment:
```
renv::deactivate(clean = TRUE)
```

{%- endif %}

## Project Structure
This structure is adapted from the TIER protocol 4.0 (https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/root/). Each folder and subfolder has to have a descriptive and meaningful name, contains the files that are supposed to be in there, and a readme file documents the content of each.
